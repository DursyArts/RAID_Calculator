## Currently not finished.
Features to be added:

- [ ] use Polymorphism classes to define Raid levels instead of hardcoded switch statement
- [ ] Let the user dynamically add and remove disks
- [ ] GUI?
- [ ] Implement Drive speeds, loads, performance indicators

feel free to add raid levels into the switch statement.
